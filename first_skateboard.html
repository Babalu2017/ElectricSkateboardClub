                        very first electric skateboard. There’s also a good chance that you might be overwhelmed,
                        confused, or a nervous parent trying to secure this purchase for a child eager to shred the
                        streets! However, the anxiety stops here. I, Terminal X, am here to provide an easy yet thorough
                        guide for anyone attempting to navigate their first electric skateboard. Welcome! It’s an
                        exciting product, filled with great times and memories for years to come. I personally have
                        owned seven electric skateboards in my riding career, and I’m on the hunt for one or two new
                        ones this year.</p>
                    <p>
                        This guide will break down some factors to consider in an electric skateboard, as well as help
                        the reader in deciding what’s a priority for their board. I’ll highlight the most popular
                        features, and I’ll be sure to help the reader navigate some pitfalls (including some I made).
                        Once your board arrives, that first unboxing and riding feeling will be made even more secure
                        knowing that you made the best choice possible in your very first electric skateboard!

                        This is the workhorse electric skateboard, the original style that stormed onto the personal
                        electric vehicle world several years ago now. This board doesn’t need to be anything fancy,
                        since it’s merely a Point A to Point B transporter (which can still be fun). This type of board
                        only needs average range, since the average commuter on an electric skateboard isn’t riding much
                        more than several miles one way. If you’re riding more than 12-15 miles one way for a commute,
                        you might want to look at some boards further down in the article that have bigger batteries.
                        It’s assumed that the board can be charged at work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board needs to be smooth, comfortable, and an easy ride. A high top speed isn’t necessary,
                        but unless the commuter is taking bike trails and sidewalks exclusively, this electric
                        skateboard will need to at least somewhat keep up with city street traffic. Larger wheels tend
                        to eat up precious battery, but some city streets can be rough and outright dangerous for
                        smaller urethane wheels. Therefore, some commuters might want a form of AT wheels for a smoother
                        and safer experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most boards in this category can be purchased for anywhere between $400 and $1200. Most of the
                        differences in these commuter boards would be battery size, quality of parts, and customer
                        service offerings (if any).</p>
                    <p>One thing is important to note on commuting boards. While many companies do their best to seal
                        the board, no electric skateboard is able to survive extended periods in the rain. Wheels with
                        tread might prevent the commuter from slipping and sliding on the road, but it’s highly
                        recommended to stick to alternative transportation in wet conditions, especially when braking
                        depends on electronic components not failing due to water.</p>

                        Carving refers to the ability to make small yet sharp turning motions with the electric
                        skateboard. A fluid motion, carving is often seen on traditional longboards, as well as
                        snowboards and skis. In short, it’s a very relaxing, almost casually thrilling activity that
                        requires a fluid core movement with the hips and legs. With carving being quite rhythmic, it’s
                        enjoyable to feel the electric skateboard effortlessly glide forward while the rider shifts
                        their weight into alternating legs quickly, allowing the board to dart in one direction briefly,
                        before snapping back into line. Carving isn’t just fun however. It’s also used to slow down a
                        board. Instead of blowing full speed ahead in a straight line, carving forces the board to
                        change into different directions rapidly, reducing its velocity. Unsurprisingly, carving is also
                        a great leg workout.
                    </p>
                    <p>While it’s rare to have an electric skateboard be marketed solely for carving, there are several
                        boards that excel in carving and make it a top feature. Almost all of these electric skateboards
                        utilize double kingpin trucks. Evolve, Wowgo, Ownboard, and others all sell boards with DKP
                        trucks. They utilize double the bushings and allow for a very smooth and easy carving
                        experience.</p>

                        Electric skateboards with DKP trucks can turn quickly and with less effort. This also comes in
                        handy maneuvering tight spaces in the city on an electric skateboard, as a DKP truck can make
                        very tight turns with a much smaller radius. However, without dialing down the right bushing
                        setup (which could be another article entirely), DKP trucks can be extremely unstable at high
                        speeds. The higher probability for wobbles makes DKP trucks for many electric skateboard riders,
                        who would prefer to go far and fast instead of carving slowly. While many DKP truck boards may
                        be less stable out of the box, taking the time to locate the right bushing setup for you will
                        pay massive dividends of fun. The right bushings in a DKP setup can allow the rider to recover
                        most of the stability from their traditional trucks, while still maintaining the therapeutic
                        thrill of carving.

                        Riptide bushings that were recommended based on my weight and board, and switching from DKP back
                        to regular trucks feels almost stiff and lethargic. I still have incredible stability (which
                        also comes with experience).</p>

                        For those who think paved roads are boring, some electric skateboards come equipped with the
                        wheels and torque needed to conquer the wilderness. While these boards will also perform just
                        fine in cities, they have specific traits that make them adept for off-road shredding.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The first obvious trait is the wheels. They need to be large (at
                        least 155mm, but larger is almost always better) and with some tread. Pneumatic (air filled)
                        wheels are the most ideal for comfort and the ability to handle severe undulations. There are a
                        few “off-road” boards that blur this line. For example, the Raldey Carbon AT uses airless 195mm
                        tires with mixed results. The Backfire Ranger series uses airless tires with hub motors built
                        into the wheels. While these might do fine on very smooth, basic conditions, the airless tires
                        and hub motors will not provide the grip and power needed to propel a rider through rough
                        conditions. </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Another important feature is the motors and the torque they deliver.
                        While a top speed isn’t a primary goal when off-roading, riders will need extensive power to
                        push the weighted board through all types of terrain. Dirt, gravel, and thick bush are all
                        stubborn friction for an electric skateboard, and it takes powerful motors to propel the board.
                        Riders should look for belt motors with a lower KV rating (this generally provides lower speed
                        but higher torque) and higher watts (more power in general). Gear drive and chain drive
                        (extremely rare) would also provide this torque. While uncommon, some electric skateboards come
                        in 4WD variants, which would help greatly when off-roading, as the motors will provide double
                        the power.</p>

                        depending on how severe the terrain will be. For example, an off-road board should have a sealed
                        enclosure to help prevent water and dirt from hurting the electronics. Some of the most hardcore
                        off-road boards (such as Trampa) utilize aggressive flexible decks to help with shock
                        absorption. Some also use bindings to keep their feet locked into the board (being strapped to a
                        powerful electric board has some risk, so be careful). </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">This priority is naturally straightforward. Electric skateboard
                        riders that plan on taking long treks on the board should always look for the largest battery
                        capacity possible. Many board manufacturers offer extended range batteries or versions of the
                        board with a larger battery. A possible option is to invest in an electric skateboard with
                        easily swappable batteries. This would allow riders to double their range within a few seconds
                        and continue the journey. A final recommendation for long distance riders is to look into
                        smaller wheels to save a good percentage of range on their electric skateboard (all-terrain
                        wheels can chew through batteries quickly).</p>

                        It’s always fun to have the faster board. However, if this is your first electric skateboard,
                        it’s really important to set proper expectations and keep safety in mind. Even if you have some
                        skating or downhill longboard experience, riding a high performance electric skateboard takes
                        time and muscle memory. 30MPH with a car or motorcycle would seem lethargic, but 30MPH on a slab
                        of bamboo with no airbag is otherworldly. Therefore, it’s important to start slow and learn how
                        to ride the electric skateboard correctly before you hit the drag strip trying to break records.

                        you need something faster, there are several performance boards that can carry speeds well past
                        40mph (which is honestly insane). LaCroix, Metroboard, Kaly NYC, BioBoards, and a few prominent
                        DIY builders all create monster electric skateboards. Many refuse to announce the top speed of
                        their products to keep riders from pushing past the point of safe riding. Most of these speed
                        demons utilize massive batteries and motors to push the board to its max potential. Belt drive
                        and gear drive motors will be used on most of these boards. It’s absolutely essential that
                        riders of these fast electric skateboards wear maximum safety gear (helmets, pads, gloves, even
                        armored jackets). They should also expect to put in hundreds of hours of riding to build that
                        muscle memory to ride safely at top speeds.</p>

                        service, maintenance, and possibly warranty fulfillment. With the type of harsh treatment the
                        streets can give to a board, as well as the thousands of miles one can ride, it’s only natural
                        that a board would need a new part. Therefore, good service and warranty should be a prominent
                        factor to consider in the purchase of a first electric skateboard.</p>

                        manufacturers. First time buyers will quickly notice that the majority of electric skateboard
                        companies (especially for budget boards) are based in China. Many US companies even get their
                        products and parts right from China! It’s important to set proper expectations when dealing with
                        service across the Pacific. There will be extended shipping times, and communication will
                        usually take longer. The language barrier will also be tricky sometimes.</p>

                        company, there are a few recommendations for dealing with their service. Patience is paramount
                        when waiting for replies. Writing emails in simple English is important. Repeating oneself a few
                        times is a good idea. Attaching lots of pictures and videos to your warranty request will speed
                        things up quickly too. Remember that they are likely reading your messages through a translator,
                        so skip the local colloquial slang. Almost every chinese company offers customer service via
                        WeChat as well. From experience, we can tell that their response time is a lot quicker compared
                        to mail.</p>
                    <p>If you’re willing to spend the extra dough for a local electric skateboard maker, you’ll usually
                        enjoy much faster replies, as well as a more personal dialogue with the company. You’ll skip the
                        misunderstandings and vague responses because they speak English (or your native language).
                        Shipping will be exponentially faster if the company keeps parts supplied locally.</p>

                        electric skateboard to be safe. An important strategy for a new buyer is to research the brand
                        that they are interested in and look for common issues amongst customers. They can look in
                        various online communities to see which brands are helping their customers, and which electric
                        skateboards are causing problems. </p>
                    <p>No brand or board is 100% guaranteed not to have issues. That said, it’s generally true that the

                        have fewer issues. A few Chinese companies have begun to develop repair centers in the USA and
                        Europe, but this is still a rarity. At the end of the day, the best assurance for a safe and
                        reputable electric skateboard is a healthy amount of research, proper maintenance, and safe
                        riding.</p>

                        durability is also an important factor. Some common board issues are plastic enclosures braking,
                        hub sleeves wearing out (the rear motorized wheels on a hub motor electric skateboard), even
                        decks or trucks snapping! It’s very important to reach out to online electric skateboard
                        communities and see what issues longtime customers have dealt with. Another common situation is
                        belts wearing out or snapping on belt motor boards, but that’s considered normal and routine.
                        While some problems are considered unfortunate but recoverable, a few electric skateboards have
                        had common issues that are very dangerous. Do your research in order to ride with confidence!

                        they tend to ride faster and longer. This inevitably leads to dissatisfaction in their current
                        battery’s range. When looking at different boards, it’s a good idea to overestimate how much
                        range you’ll actually use. A common theme with electric skateboard companies is that they tend
                        to stretch or exaggerate the range claims, so normal or aggressive riding usually yields less
                        mileage than advertised. If the board you’re interested in has an ER battery option, it’s always
                        better to save a little longer and get that model. Extra batteries to swap out are also a good
                        idea.<span class="font-weight-bold">Remember, you can always finish your ride or commute early

                        new board. While top speed seems like an obvious metric, torque is another important factor.
                        Good torque will get the rider off the line and up to their top speed faster. An electric
                        skateboard with ample torque will also propel the rider up a hill far more quickly. Electric
                        skateboards with belt drive and gear drive motors tend to fare better with torque, but hub motor
                        boards eventually catch up and can even overtake them in some cases! Generally speaking, larger
                        wheels will equal less torque but a higher top speed. In addition to power off the line, braking
                        power is also usually stronger with belt and gear drive board, allowing riders to come to a stop
                        in a shorter distance.</p>

                        this, many rider’s first boards tend to be hub motors. While they require a bit less maintenance
                        than belts, they lack torque and are usually less comfortable (the rear wheels are only slim
                        urethane sleeves on metal cans, not exactly a plush feeling). Hub motors also mean that swapping
                        out for different wheels isn’t possible. That said, they are quieter, and swapping out a
                        replacement hub is pretty straightforward. Reputable companies with hub motor boards:</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The vast majority of mid-range electric skateboards are belts. The
                        legendary Boosted Board brought this to the forefront, and budget brands have been switching to
                        belt drive ever since! Belt drives are a little whinier (although some think this is cool) but
                        provide the rider loads of torque and power. Many belt drive boards offer the ability to swap
                        wheels. Belts will eventually wear out and need replacement. In addition, getting a belt to be
                        the right tension can be a small learning curve, but most riders say that fiddling around and
                        carrying a couple of extra belts in their bag is worth the joy! Reputable companies with belt

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Direct drive is less common but has some unique advantages. There’s
                        no belts involved, but the motors still provide strong torque directly to the wheels. Some
                        direct drive boards allow for different wheels. However, direct drive motors are placed directly
                        on the skateboard trucks. This means that the motors are placed precariously low to the ground,
                        which can create opportunities for damage from rough streets. Reputable companies with direct
