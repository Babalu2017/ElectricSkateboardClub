              <h1>COVID-19: Its impact on electric skateboarding</h1>
              <h6 class="text-center mb-4">Written by Andy</h6>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                The outbreak of Coronavirus, or COVID-19, 
                has rapidly spread across the globe. The virus has thrown the 
                world’s economy into turmoil, resulting in a major crash of both Wall Street and global trade.              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">The World Trade Organization has 
                stated that global trade is expected to fall by between 13-32% in 2020 as the 
                Coronavirus pandemic continues.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Disruptions to supply chains, especially 
                those from China where much of the world’s electronic goods and raw materials are manufactured, is having widespread effects. Many companies are feeling the pinch, with some either temporarily
                halting business or, sadly, even going into liquidation.
              </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0;">Obviously, this isn’t good news for anyone, no matter where you are in the world
                and for us passionate electric skateboard enthusiasts it’s becoming heartbreaking.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Not only is social distancing and countrywide lockdowns making it impossible for us to ride our beloved electric skateboards, but also the current state of the world economy is having a major impact on many of the electric 
                skateboard manufacturers we all know and love</p>
              <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">Let’s take an in-depth look at what this means 
                for the electric skateboard market..</p>
            </div>
  
            <div class="col-md-6  d-flex align-self-center">

              />
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 order-2 order-md-1">
              <h2 class="mt-1">First bad news</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                There hasn’t been great news coming out of the electric skateboard manufacturer camps of recent times. Many companies have been taking financial hits trade tariffs, component price hikes, and badly formulated legislation, 
                forcing electric mobility users completely off the streets.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">Sadly, there have been regulations put together in some countries recently that have either entirely banned the use of electric mobility devices, including electric skateboards, or made it much harder to use them. Some laws now state that riders require insurance, registration, 
                or must comply with either speed limits or restricted areas of use.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                While other companies have been forced 
                to branch into ventures in hopes to keep their investors happy. 
              </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0;">This puts a lot of pressure on kickstarted companies to grow much faster than perhaps they should. Companies often overreach and find themselves investing in ventures that perhaps they shouldn’t be, 
                putting their entire enterprise at risk. Another huge pressure on electric 
                skateboard companies has been the recent trade/tariff war between both 
                America and China. This has made vital electronic parts and components more 
                expensive than they once were, 
                increasing manufacturing costs and reducing profits margins.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">Now, regrettably, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit. Furthering the pressure that many businesses, 
                including electric skateboard companies, are feeling.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">So, who is in trouble?</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">Which electric skateboard companies are faltering 
                  under all this pressure?</p>
                <p>Let’s take a look.</p>
            </div>
  
            <div class="col-md-6 d-flex align-self-center mt-3 order-1 order-md-2">

              <h3 class="d-none d-sm-block">Boosted</h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Boosted, how in the world did, arguably, the most popular and 
                well known electric skateboard company fall to its knees?
                If you were anything like me, the announcement that Boosted 
                electric skateboards was laying off all its staff 
                and going into liquidation was a real shock!</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">Boosted, who have been 
                producing boards since 2012, sadly, 
                looks to have made the same mistake Inboard did.
                The Californian startup made its first step out of the electric 
                skateboard market last year (2019) with the launch of an electric 
                scooter. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Boosted was set to release a $1,600 electric scooter they called the Rev, moving the company into a more diversified direction. However, this seems to have been a 
                mistake that has cost the company dearly. Since the company claimed it had finished work on the Rev back in May of 2019, Boosted has been reported to have owed money to several of its vendors and reportedly 
                was slipping further and further into debt.
              </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0;">Couple this with the company also being under constant pressure from the trade war between America and China and you have the economic 
                formula that ended Boosted electric skateboards. 
                Boosted has had its boards manufactured in China since 2016, and have felt 
                the full effects of President Donald Trumps 25 percent tariffs. The company claims that they had applied and were granted exclusions from these tariffs in late 2019, 
                but thus far had not been reimbursed.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">Meaning the company was seriously out of pocket, 
                possibly millions of dollars was owed to them.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">Their failed electric scooter venture tied with the trade war has, sadly, 
                  spelt the end of one of the best electric skateboards on the market.</p>

              <h3 class="d-none d-sm-block">Enertion</h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                The Australian electric skateboard company Enertion has, sadly, announced the company 
                has gone into liquidation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">The company has been embroiled in a long fight to find investors. It seems the fight is over as the company’s CEO Jason Potter announced recently that they could not find the investors 
                they were looking for and have decided it best to admit defeat.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                And so goes yet another electric skateboard company that has succumb 
                to the current global economic climate.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Fiik is an electric skateboard company that was set to launch a rideshare venture in the Gold Coast in Queensland Australia. The company has, unfortunately, been forced to put the 
                launch on hold due to the impacts of COVID-19.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">While this rideshare venture of theirs was set around the company’s branch into electric scooters and not electric skateboards per se, it is still, no doubt, hurting the company’s bottom line and 
                affecting normal operations at the company.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Factoring in all of the above issues, the trade wars, expected investor returns, and a volatile global economic climate, and you’d forgive any 
                company going belly up and filing bankruptcy. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">Couple that with the current COVID-19 
                pandemic and there is a real problem. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                The virus is having an unexpected 
                impact on many established and emerging technology companies. 
              </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0;">Electric vehicle sales have tumbled since the outbreak, with the world’s biggest electric vehicle market, 
                China, seeing retail car sales fall up to 80%.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">The Coronavirus has also lowered oil prices. Low oil prices reduce the cost of petrol or gas at the pumps. When this happens 
                there is usually a decline of interest in electric vehicles.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">And how is China’s electric car sales related to the electric skateboard market?
                  Well, the bulk of the world’s lithium and lithium batteries are manufactured in China. The lack of demand for the product has resulted in companies such as Ganfeng Lithium, 
                  China’s biggest lithium producer, to raise their prices.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">Lithium batteries are at the heart of any good electric skateboard, vital components such as lithium batteries or other electronics becoming more 
                  expensive are really hurting technology-based companies.
                  Apple is finding it hard to source parts to produce phones, 
                  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) sales are also expected to take a hit, and 
                  Emerson Electric, a manufacturer of small motors and electronics, has stated 
                  they are likely 
                  to drop 100-150 million USD in second-quarter sales.</p>
                <p>This is shaping up to be an across the board problem and if it’s hitting the big guys like Apple or AMD, you can bet your bottom dollar that the comparably small electric 
                  skateboard companies are definitely feeling the squeeze.</p>

              <h2 class="d-none d-sm-block">Now for some good news</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ok, now with all that 
                depressing news aside, let’s take a look at some good news. In circumstances such as these the only real 
                course of action is to ask ourselves, how can we help?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">Well, there isn’t a whole lot we can do. However, one such thing is to spend some money with these electric 
                skateboard companies to help them out and show your support. I know many of us are having trouble making ends meet, however, 
                if you are able to buy one of their products then do!</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                If you have been considering buying your first board or maybe grabbing a second or third board 
                for different riding applications, then now is a better time then ever! 
              </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0;">There is no doubt, social distancing is making riding an electric skateboard almost impossible. However, if we want our favourite electric skateboarding manufacturers to still be around and the sport to be in a healthy 
                place when this pandemic comes to an end, we must show our support.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">It’s up to all of us to keep this sport we all love so much alive and well.
              </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">And how is China’s electric car sales related to the electric skateboard market?
