          <h1>COVID-19: Its impact on electric skateboarding</h1>
          <h6 class="text-center mb-4">Written by Andy</h6>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The outbreak of Coronavirus, or COVID-19,
            has rapidly spread across the globe. The virus has thrown the
            world’s economy into turmoil, resulting in a major crash of both Wall Street and global trade. </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">The World Trade Organization has
            stated that global trade is expected to fall by between 13-32% in 2020 as the
            Coronavirus pandemic continues.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Disruptions to supply chains, especially
            those from China where much of the world’s electronic goods and raw materials are manufactured, is having
            widespread effects. Many companies are feeling the pinch, with some either temporarily
            halting business or, sadly, even going into liquidation.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Obviously, this isn’t good news for anyone, no matter where you are in the world
            and for us passionate electric skateboard enthusiasts it’s becoming heartbreaking.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Not only is social distancing and countrywide lockdowns making it impossible for
            us to ride our beloved electric skateboards, but also the current state of the world economy is having a
            major impact on many of the electric
            skateboard manufacturers we all know and love</p>
          <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">Let’s take an in-depth look at what this means
            for the electric skateboard market..</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6  d-flex align-self-center">
          <img src="assets/images/newsIMG/covid19EskateCartoon.jpg" alt=""
            class="img-fluid d-none d-md-block rounded about-img" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 order-2 order-md-1">
          <h2 class="mt-1">First bad news</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            There hasn’t been great news coming out of the electric skateboard manufacturer camps of recent times. Many
            companies have been taking financial hits trade tariffs, component price hikes, and badly formulated
            legislation,
            forcing electric mobility users completely off the streets.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">Sadly, there have been regulations put together in some
            countries
            recently that have either entirely banned the use of electric mobility devices, including electric
            skateboards, or made it much harder to use them. Some laws now state that riders require insurance,
            registration,
            or must comply with either speed limits or restricted areas of use.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            While other companies have been forced
            to branch into ventures in hopes to keep their investors happy.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">This puts a lot of pressure on kickstarted companies to grow much faster than
            perhaps they should. Companies often overreach and find themselves investing in ventures that perhaps they
            shouldn’t be,
            putting their entire enterprise at risk. Another huge pressure on electric
            skateboard companies has been the recent trade/tariff war between both
            America and China. This has made vital electronic parts and components more
            expensive than they once were,
            increasing manufacturing costs and reducing profits margins.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">Now, regrettably, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit. Furthering the pressure
            that many businesses,
            including electric skateboard companies, are feeling.</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">So, who is in trouble?</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Which electric skateboard companies are faltering
            under all this pressure?</p>
          <p>Let’s take a look.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6 d-flex align-self-center mt-3 order-1 order-md-2">
          <img src="assets/images/newsIMG/bedNewsCartoon.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid rounded about-img" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 order-2 order-md-1">
          <h3 class="d-none d-sm-block">Boosted</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Boosted, how in the world did, arguably, the most popular and
            well known electric skateboard company fall to its knees?
            If you were anything like me, the announcement that Boosted
            electric skateboards was laying off all its staff
            and going into liquidation was a real shock!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">Boosted, who have been
            producing boards since 2012, sadly,
            looks to have made the same mistake Inboard did.
            The Californian startup made its first step out of the electric
            skateboard market last year (2019) with the launch of an electric
            scooter. </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Boosted was set to release a $1,600 electric scooter they called the Rev, moving the company into a more
            diversified direction. However, this seems to have been a
            mistake that has cost the company dearly. Since the company claimed it had finished work on the Rev back in
            May of 2019, Boosted has been reported to have owed money to several of its vendors and reportedly
            was slipping further and further into debt.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Couple this with the company also being under constant pressure from the trade war
            between America and China and you have the economic
            formula that ended Boosted electric skateboards.
            Boosted has had its boards manufactured in China since 2016, and have felt
            the full effects of President Donald Trumps 25 percent tariffs. The company claims that they had applied and
            were granted exclusions from these tariffs in late 2019,
            but thus far had not been reimbursed.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">Meaning the company was seriously out of pocket,
            possibly millions of dollars was owed to them.</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Their failed electric scooter venture tied with the trade war has, sadly,
            spelt the end of one of the best electric skateboards on the market.</p>
        </div>

          <h3 class="d-none d-sm-block">Enertion</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The Australian electric skateboard company Enertion has, sadly, announced the company
            has gone into liquidation.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">The company has been embroiled in a long fight to find
            investors.
            It seems the fight is over as the company’s CEO Jason Potter announced recently that they could not find the
            investors
            they were looking for and have decided it best to admit defeat.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            And so goes yet another electric skateboard company that has succumb
            to the current global economic climate.

          <h3 class="d-none d-sm-block">Fiik</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Fiik is an electric skateboard company that was set to launch a rideshare venture in the Gold Coast in
            Queensland Australia. The company has, unfortunately, been forced to put the
            launch on hold due to the impacts of COVID-19.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">While this rideshare venture of theirs was set around the
            company’s branch into electric scooters and not electric skateboards per se, it is still, no doubt, hurting
            the company’s bottom line and
            affecting normal operations at the company.</p>
        </div>

          <h2 class="d-none d-sm-block">The Covid-19 effect</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Factoring in all of the above issues, the trade wars, expected investor returns, and a volatile global
            economic climate, and you’d forgive any
            company going belly up and filing bankruptcy. </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">Couple that with the current COVID-19
            pandemic and there is a real problem. </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The virus is having an unexpected
            impact on many established and emerging technology companies.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Electric vehicle sales have tumbled since the outbreak, with the world’s biggest
            electric vehicle market,
            China, seeing retail car sales fall up to 80%.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">The Coronavirus has also lowered oil prices. Low oil prices reduce the
            cost of petrol or gas at the pumps. When this happens
            there is usually a decline of interest in electric vehicles.</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">And how is China’s electric car sales related to the electric skateboard market?
            Well, the bulk of the world’s lithium and lithium batteries are manufactured in China. The lack of demand
            for the product has resulted in companies such as Ganfeng Lithium,
            China’s biggest lithium producer, to raise their prices.</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">Lithium batteries are at the heart of any good electric skateboard, vital
            components such as lithium batteries or other electronics becoming more
            expensive are really hurting technology-based companies.
            Apple is finding it hard to source parts to produce phones,
            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) sales are also expected to take a hit, and
            Emerson Electric, a manufacturer of small motors and electronics, has stated
            they are likely
            to drop 100-150 million USD in second-quarter sales.</p>
          <p>This is shaping up to be an across the board problem and if it’s hitting the big guys like Apple or AMD,
            you can bet your bottom dollar that the comparably small electric
            skateboard companies are definitely feeling the squeeze.</p>

          <h2 class="d-none d-sm-block">Now for some good news</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ok, now with all that
            depressing news aside, let’s take a look at some good news. In circumstances such as these the only real
            course of action is to ask ourselves, how can we help?</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 0;">Well, there isn’t a whole lot we can do. However, one such
            thing
            is to spend some money with these electric
            skateboard companies to help them out and show your support. I know many of us are having trouble making
            ends meet, however,
            if you are able to buy one of their products then do!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            If you have been considering buying your first board or maybe grabbing a second or third board
            for different riding applications, then now is a better time then ever!
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">There is no doubt, social distancing is making riding an electric skateboard almost
            impossible. However, if we want our favourite electric skateboarding manufacturers to still be around and
            the sport to be in a healthy
            place when this pandemic comes to an end, we must show our support.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: 0;">It’s up to all of us to keep this sport we all love so much alive and
            well.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0;">And how is China’s electric car sales related to the electric skateboard market?
            Well, the bulk of the world’s lithium and lithium batteries are manufactured in China. The lack of demand

            China’s biggest lithium producer, to raise their prices.</p>
          <p>Stay safe guys!</p>
