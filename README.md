        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with people that share my same interest  and ask any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added meetups.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are black, gray, and red provided by bootstrap, also I added some costum colors using scss variables.
    -   #### Typography
        -    I used the default bootstrap font-family "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif The font is used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I think this font is a clean and it is used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. I used the carousel so the main images will change every 5 seconds. They are all links to different pages (call action with bottoms).

        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    -   Once I fixed the previous bug another one came out, Carousel stopped working. I used [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26863003/how-to-reset-the-bootstrap-modal-when-it-gets-closed-and-open-it-fresh-again)
-   Videos and Carousel and SlideShow didn't work on Github pages. the issues were caused by http src inside the script.It was solved by adding the secure protocol. I used Stack Overflow again.
