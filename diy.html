                        What So you’ve decided to hop on the e-board bandwagon; good for you. Walking is too slow, and old-school boards aren’t much faster. An electric skateboard gets you from point A to point B quickly and efficiently. More importantly, it’s a lot more fun than walking, and a lot cooler than those electric scooters everyone else is renting.
                    </p>
                    <p>The only question now is whether you should buy a board or build one (and if so, how to make an electric skateboard?). It’s a tough choice and both options have advantages, and neither is right for everybody.
                    </p>
                    <p>Quality electric boards are expensive. Take a look at this list of recommended boards. Several of their recommendations are well over $1000, and the only “budget” board they recommend is still $300. One of the boards they list is over $2000.</p>
                    <p>The thing is, those more expensive boards might just be worth the money. They have more power, better battery life, higher quality materials, and a better build quality. The budget board is only listed for people who haven’t tried out electric boards yet and want to get a taste of what it’s like.
                    </p>
                    <p>Still, even if they’re worth the money, that’s a lot to spend.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">If you build your own, you can create a board that’s every bit as good as the high-end, $1k+ models on the market for a fraction of the cost.</p>
                    <p>As a bonus, you also get to put in all the features that matter most to you, without paying for anything you don’t want on your board. It’s a win-win, if you’re the sort of person who likes to take on this sort of project. If you don’t like DIY work, then it’s worth it to save up and buy a nice board.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you aren’t sure whether you can handle a project like this or not, keep reading to see what it takes to build your own electric skateboard.</p>

                    <p>If you’re going to build something, you have to understand how it works first.</p>
                    <p>An e-board is little more than a regular skateboard with a few extra components added. You’ll have a motor either a belt motor or a hub motor (more details on the difference between the two later), a battery to power the motor, an electronic speed controller, and a remote control for the throttle/braking.</p>
                    <p>You use the remote to control the speed. The remote, usually a Bluetooth device, tells the electronic speed controller (ESC) to start the motor and how quickly you want to go, and the motor turns the wheels. You steer like you would on a normal board: leaning left or right.</p>
                    <p>Building your own board allows you to really customize the board to your needs, and decided which components are more important to you. For example, a bigger motor will deplete your battery faster, but it also provides more torque which is helpful for climbing hills.</p>
                    <p>Torque also affects speed, so if you want the board to be faster, that’s a consideration. Conversely, if you want to use your board to commute to work, you might value a longer battery life over getting the most speed out of your board, and a smaller motor might be better for you. You could also pack in a big motor and a big battery, it’ll just cost you more money. If that’s what you want, though, then go for it. You might be able to save money on other parts.</p>
                    <p>If you’re purchasing a complete board from a manufacturer, you don’t have these options. You’re stuck with the motor and battery that they want, and that means you may be paying for a bigger motor than you need, or you’ll have to pay a lot more than you want to make sure that your board has enough battery life.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned before, there are two types of motors for an electric board: hub and belt motors. There was a time when belt drives were the only choice; hub drives are newer technology.</p>
                    <p>A belt drive is basically a pulley system. There’s a small gear on the motor, and a larger gear on the wheel, connected by a belt. The motor turns the small gear, which in turn pulls the belt, and the belt turns the wheel. You can see how it works in the picture below.</p>
                    <p>A hub drive, or direct drive, has the motor attached directly to the wheel. Often this means that the motor is embedded in the wheel itself, although some manufacturers simply use metal gears in direct contact with each other to connect the motor and the wheels.</p>
                    <p>There are many things to consider when choosing which drive to buy.</p>
                    <p>A belt drive will make it difficult to move your board using foot power if your battery dies, whereas with a hub drive if the battery is dead you can use it just like a regular skateboard.</p>
                    <p>A belt drive also has more moving parts, which means more potential for something to break. Yet, a hub drive is much more difficult to repair in the event of a breakdown.</p>
                    <p>Belt drives have more torque, and hence better acceleration, and better climbing on hills. At the same time, belt drives have less efficient braking.</p>
                    <p>Hub drives limit your choice of wheels more than belt drives, since most hub drives are embedded in the wheel and you’ll only be able to buy the wheels made by the motor manufacturer.</p>
                    <p>Hub drives are also much more prone to overheating, which in turn makes them less durable than belt drives. That said, hub drives are lighter, quieter, and more efficient.</p>
                    <p>Belt drives are much more difficult to assemble and install. You’ll need to attach the motor to the motor mount, attach the mount to the truck, and fix the belt onto the gear. Then you’ll need to attach the other, larger gear to the wheel.</p>
                    <p>This is going to require you to drill into the wheel so that you can use a set of bolts to fix the gear to the wheel as firmly as possible. Once the gear is attached to the wheel, then you slide that onto the truck, and you attach the belt to the larger gear.</p>
                    <p>Now, you still have to make sure that the gear on the motor and the gear on the wheel are properly aligned so that the belt isn’t pulled off the gears.</p>
                    <p>Hub drives are much simpler. Since the motor is embedded in the wheel, you just have to put the wheel on the truck and you’re all set. A lot of hub drives even come with their own trucks included, so there’s no risk of having mismatched truck and wheels.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want a quiet motor that will preserve your battery life, and is fairly easy to install, a hub drive is the best option.</p>
                    <p>If you want something that accelerates fast, or you live in an area with lots of hills, and you’re not intimidated by the extra work it takes to assemble and install, you’ll probably want a belt drive.</p>
