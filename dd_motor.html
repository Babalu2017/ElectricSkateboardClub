              <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Direct-drive boards are very new to the market, which seems to make people step away from them, but they are excellent for filling the void of a drivetrain in the middle of hub motors and belt drives. Overall I would recommend direct-drives to someone who needed an in-between of hub motors and belt drives.</p>

                The ONSRA Black Carve 2 is almost entirely different from its predecessor, the Black Carve. For starters, this board looks amazeballs! The ONSRA Black Carve 2 (in my opinion) is one of the best-looking pre-built boards made. ONSRA is definitely stepping it up with the looks of their boards. Let’s go over the differences between the Black Carve 2 and the Black Carve.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">The Black Carve 2 uses a new ESC, which allows the board to run more current, resulting in a more powerful board. The boards uses a more extended deck to house a larger battery and provide more stability. The Black Carve 2 will lose some responsiveness, but it will be much more stable, which I think is the definitely right move for this kind of board.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                The new battery is 648 watt-hours which is a considerable gain from its previous version, its also using 21700 cells which gives less sag, and any cell is better than a Samsung 35e (which is what they were previously using. The Black Carve 2 is $400~ more than the original Black Carve, but I think the upgrades that the Black Carve 2 gives you is well worth the price gain.

                The Boudmotor D1 uses double kingpin trucks and a carbon fiber deck with the electronics stored in the deck. The stiff and long deck makes the D1 more stable at higher speeds than boards like the ONSRA Black Carve, but the carve on the D1 won’t be as responsive.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">One of the unique selling points of the D1 is that it uses a VESC. In short, most boards use an ESC, which is pre-programmed, and you can’t change how the board feels. On a VESC, you can customize the braking curves, the acceleration curves, you can limit the top speed, you can make unique modes, and you can buy an aftermarket Bluetooth connector and have an app.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                This is all well and good, but VESC’s coming from Chinese budget boards can be unreliable and dangerous at times, so it might be a better choice to go straight up DIY. As I haven’t seen many reports of their VESC failing, you should be fine. If you’re not into DIY, I would recommend this board, as long as you’re willing to risk the Chinese VESC.

                Miles has been around for a while but has not been talked about much until they released the Phantom. The Miles board Phantom has an exciting and unique deck design.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1; padding-top: 0;">The deck is short but has a  drop-down which is uncommon, as a drop-down deck is suitable for high speeds while a short deck is not. As the deck uses drop-down, there is no kicktail, so sadly, you won’t be doing tic-tacs and tricks.
            </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                I think this board’s purpose is to have a fun, aggressive shortboard that is good for commuting. The Miles Phantom deck is made out of carbon fiber, making the board very light and suitable for commuting.

                Many people get these two drive types confused, so I’m going to point out the differences. Hub Motors have the motors in the wheels while direct-drives spin on the axle attached to the wheel. Hub motors are going to be quieter and will have less torque but more speed. Direct-drives are going to be a bit louder and should give more torque and less top speed. Direct-drives also allow you to run different wheels for different terrains and situations, making them a good option for someone who wants hub motors but wants more versatility.</p>

                Direct-drive and belt-drive allow you to switch wheels, but direct-drive only enables you to change wheels and not the gearing, whereas belt-drive can change gearing along with wheels. This means if you want to switch to a bigger wheel on a belt-drive, you can use a bigger drive gear to keep the same torque and speed, or you can keep the gearing to achieve a higher top speed but less torque. On a direct-drive, if you switch to a bigger wheel, you don’t have the option to compensate and thus will automatically lose torque but gain top speed; this is why most direct-drives can’t use pneumatic tires.</p>

              <p class="mt-4" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                There are enough direct-drive boards on the market now to give a good array of options for the buyer. Lots of direct-drives use double kingpin trucks, which some people love, and some people hate. Other direct-drives use reverse kingpin trucks, which are typically more stable but aren’t as surfy and carvy as double kingpin trucks. For whatever reason, lots of direct-drive boards use a 12s battery, which will give more speed than a 10s battery, so if you want a 12s battery for the speed, then you have plenty of options, but if you want to use a 10s battery to keep your board light, then you will find it harder to find a board that works for you. You have to think about if you need pneumatic tires, as most direct-drive boards on the market can’t use them. Most companies seem to offer their boards with rubber street wheels which seems to be a good mix between a pneumatic tire and a urethane wheel. These rubber wheels do eat up the range and wear very quickly, so you will want to be aware that you won’t have as much range as a urethane wheel, and you may have to buy a replacement set quicker, which is annoying as these rubber wheels are more expensive than urethane.</p>

              <p class="mt-4" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Overall the Direct-Drive motor type has many positives and is an excellent option for people who like hub motors but want more wheel options. There are many options for a board that uses direct-drive motors, and I hope that this helps you figure out which one best suits your needs and also, I hope that I could teach you something about direct-drive.</p>

              <h3 class="mt-1">Final Thoughts</h3>
              <p class="mt-4" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                The price of direct-drive boards varies, but you don’t start seeing them until the 1k mark. There are some exceptions for this, but as a general price point, it seems to start at 1k. That price can go up to 2k and higher depending on which board you choose. As direct-drives are new, many people seem to use them in the DIY scene as there aren’t that many pre-built direct-drive boards as other drivetrains, but there plenty of good options for a pre-built direct-drive board.</p>
